I am currently a Product Manager at Microsoft working on Medical Foundation Models and on our Healthcare Data Platform.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Microsoft Research Special Projects working on privacy and security research. The broad motivations of my research are represented in paper I wrote in collaboration with OpenAI titled "[Contextual Confidence and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01193)". 

If my work on privacy or security seems interesting to you, here is my [Microsoft Research profile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shreyjain/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrey-j-9869b213a/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyjaineth) where I post more about work.
