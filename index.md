## About 

I am a TPM Microsoft. I believe that AI has the ability to do a lot of harm, and my work is currently focused on mitigating the impact of that harm, especially towards our ability to communicate with one another. If that seems interesting to you, here is my [Microsoft Research profile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shreyjain/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrey-j-9869b213a/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyjaineth) where I post more about work. 

I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Harvard Democracy Renovation Lab](https://gettingplurality.org/people/) where I am supporting policy research related to privacy enhancing technologies and AI. I also believe the way we govern technologies is really important, and I am supporting in mechanism design research at the [Gov4Git Foundation](https://gov4git.org/). I am also an [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) award winner.  

I am based in San Fransisco. Email is shreyjaineth AT gmail.com. 

When I am not working, I love biking and running in the Bay. I also love basketball and triathlon. I have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons. Prior to triathlon, I rowed and raced the double as well as swam comeptitively in the 50, 100, and 200m breastroke.
