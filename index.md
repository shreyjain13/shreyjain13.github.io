### My Research 


My research is concerned with safeguarding the authenticity and accuracy of information. 

I am Applied Scientist at [Microsoft Research Special Projects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-research-special-projects/) and Co-Founder of the [Plural Technology Collaboratory](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/) at Microsoft Research. 

The central question I am attempting to address is: How we can design systems to counteract information integrity risks from Large Foundation Models and promote democratic pluralism? 

I have attempted at addressing this ambitious problem through answering different narrow questions. 

1. How can we build digital communication channels that are shielded from deception?

2. How can we trust who we are communicating with online? 

### Relevent Contributions 

I have occasional posts on this site, but write more frequently at [Glasswing](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/). 

### Previous Work 

Previously, I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology & MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/) as well as worked with Microsoft's Health & AI team. 

Previously, I has also worked on building [COVID-19 prevalence prediction tools](https://flatten.ca) advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. 

I graduated from the University of Toronto, studying Engineering Science with a major in machine intelligence. 

## Fun 

I love to travel (at 50 countries so far), and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
