Working on personal branding in the Metaverse and DAO tooling.

Previously, I did some work in healthcare, both [public health](https://flatten.ca) and [machine learning for health (domain generalization)](https://shreyj.com/publications).

I used to be a triathlete qualifying for three World Championships for Team Canada Triathlon for my age group and have a history of high performing sports. I now get enjoyment from my individual quantified self health explorations but still love to cycle and play pick up basketball.

Currently enrolled at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in machine learning (graduating 2023 spring).
