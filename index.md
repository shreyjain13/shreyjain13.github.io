I currently work at Microsoft. I work on projects related to privacy and security with our Special Projects team at Microsoft Research as well as with our Health and Life Sciences team. 

The broad motivations of my work is represented in a recent paper I wrote with OpenAI titled "[Contextual Confidence and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01193)". 

If this works seems interesting to you, here is my [Microsoft Research profile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shreyjain/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrey-j-9869b213a/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyjaineth) where I post more about work. 

I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Harvard Democracy Renovation Lab](https://gettingplurality.org/people/) and [Gov4Git Foundation](https://gov4git.org/), as well as an [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) award winner.  

Previously, I co-founded the [PTC lab at Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/), did clinical machine learning research under Marzyeh Ghassemi and Leo Anthony Celi at MIT CSAIL,  Vector Institute, and MIT Institute for Medical Engineering Sciences. I also was the [Founder of Flatten](https://flatten.ca/), a COVID-19 symptom surveillance non-profit, advised by Nick Frosst and Geoffrey Hinton. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Engineering Science and major in machine learning (thesis advisor Stark Draper). 

I am based in San Fransisco. 

I love triathlon and have so far qualified for 3 age group world championships. If you ever want to ride, bike, or swim, reach out! I also play basketball.
