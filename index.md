## About 

I am Shrey Jain. 

I do AI research at Microsoft. I care a lot about communication, and most of my work is currently centered around designing techniques to protect human communication. If that seems interesting to you, here is my [Microsoft Research profile](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shreyjain/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrey-j-9869b213a/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyjaineth) where I post more about that. 

I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Harvard Democracy Renovation Lab](https://gettingplurality.org/people/), [Gov4Git Foundation](https://gov4git.org/), and a fellow at the [DRC](https://thedrcenter.org/) and [Interact](https://joininteract.com/).

I am based in San Fransisco.

## Fun 

I love biking and running. I spend most of my time between pickup basketball and triathlons. I have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en). Prior to triathlon, I rowed and raced the double as well as swam comeptitively in the 50, 100, and 200m breastroke. 

I also love trying new foods with people who are seriously passionate about trying new foods. Here is a list of my [top indian restaurants](/indianfood.md)
