I am a Web3 researcher at Microsoft. My research focuses on coordination and identity. I am also a technical advisor to product teams at Microsoft and its partners on the best ways to explore Web3 incubations. Shrey works under Glen Weyl and Yorke Rhodes and collaborates with key Web3 researchers like Vitalik Buterin. 

I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology and MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/) as well as worked with Microsoft's Health & AI team. Previously, I has also launched [large-scale healthcare](https://flatten.ca) projects during the COVID-19 pandemic projects advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. I love to travel, and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
