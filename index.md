I am a Web3 researcher at Microsoft. My research focuses on coordination and identity. I am also a technical advisor to product teams at Microsoft and its partners on the best ways to explore Web3 incubations. I work under Glen Weyl and Yorke Rhodes and collaborate with key Web3 researchers like Vitalik Buterin. 

I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology and MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/) as well as worked with Microsoft's Health & AI team. Previously, I has also launched [large-scale healthcare](https://flatten.ca) projects during the COVID-19 pandemic projects advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. I love to travel, and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
