Contributing to the Metaverse. 

Previously, I built products for [public health](https://flatten.ca) during the COVID-19 pandemic and did research in [machine learning for health](https://shreyj.com/previous).

For fun, I am currently playing around with generative models to create digital art and music (because I can't sing or draw I let computers help). I used to be a triathlete qualifying for three World Championships for Team Canada Triathlon and love to race. Always up for a game of pickup basketball too : )

Currently enrolled at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in machine learning (graduating 2023 spring).
