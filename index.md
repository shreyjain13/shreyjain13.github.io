**Contributing to the Metaverse.**

Previously, I built products for [public health teams](https://flatten.ca) during the COVID-19 pandemic and did research in [machine learning for health](https://shreyj.com/previous).

For fun, I am playing around with generative models to create digital art and music. I wish I could sing or draw, but I can't so I rely on machine learning to help me out. I used to be a triathlete qualifying for three World Championships for Team Canada Triathlon and love to run, swim, row, race really expensive road/TT bikes, and play pickup basketball. 

I am a slight coffee snob and recently started rating coffee shops [here](https://shreyj.com/coffee/). 

Currently enrolled at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in machine learning (graduating 2023 spring).
