### My Research 

My research is concerned with safeguarding the authenticity and accuracy of information. 

I am Applied Scientist at [Microsoft Research Special Projects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-research-special-projects/) and Co-Founder of the [Plural Technology Collaboratory](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/) at Microsoft Research. 

The central question I am attempting to address is: How we can design systems to counteract information integrity risks from Large Foundation Models and promote democratic pluralism? 

I have attempted at addressing this ambitious problem through answering different narrower questions. 

1. How can we build digital communication channels that are shielded from threats due to generative AI?

2. How can we trust who we are communicating with online? 

### Relevent Contributions

1) [**Plural Publics**](https://gettingplurality.org/2023/03/18/plural-publics/). Published in the Harvard Safra Centre for Ethics. 

In this paper, we defined a new framework for thinking about privacy in the age of LFMs. Instead of viewing data governance in the traditional “privacy” vs “publicity” lens, we offered a new approach that shields communication channels from threats to contextual integrity due to LFMs, while still allowing broad, global, instantaneous communication.

This is a research direction I have been leading at Microsoft Research which you can read more about [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/articles/plural-publics/). 

2) [**Designated Verifier Signatures**](https://ethresear.ch/t/designated-verifier-signatures/15100). 

In this project, I co-designed a way to bring an older cryptographic primitive to be accessible for sending **deniable** messages. On the one hand, this primtive can be incredibly useful for protecting your messages from being trained on or taken action upon (protecting secrets), and on the other hand is useful for AI labs to have confidence the message was written by the sender (which may or may not be human). 

3) **Identity Standards** 

Watermarking and content provenance (ie., C2PA) are being widely discussed as ways to improve information authenticity. We have seen how without some identity standard to pair with these techniques, they alone do not solve the threats from generative AI being discussed. Additionally, without an identity layer that is resistent to Sybil threats, censorship, and coersion, any reputation system becomes infeasible to build. 

I have commented on the tradeoffs between different identity primitives like Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and blockchain based standards. You can read more about this in a paper I was the lead author on titled "[A Plural Decentralized Identity Frontier: Abstraction v. Composability Tradeoffs in Web3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11443)". 

To extend on this work, I extended existing work being done with anonymous credentials to co-design [**Zero-Knowlege Identity Badges**](https://github.com/enricobottazzi/ZK-SBT). 

5) **Blog**: I post occasionally on my blog [Glasswing](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/). Some posts that are particularly relevent is my comments regarding the [sociology of secrecy](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/sociology-of-secrecy-and-secret-societies) and defining a [new turing test](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/we-need-a-new-turing-test). 

I have given numerous talks and been on many podcasts relating to this research. The one's that adress the core of my research you can find here:

### Previous Work 

My prior work has been centered in AI for healthcare applications. I worked with the [Healthcare and AI team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/health-data-services) at Microsoft on the FHIR standard, designing systems multi-modal prediction tasks with EHR, DICOM, and MedTech data. 

I was also the Founder and Research Director of a core COVID-19 prediction tool, [Flatten](https://flatten.ca). I was advised by [Professor Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) and [Nick Frosst](https://www.nickfrosst.com/) througout the duration of this project. 

I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology & MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/). 

Previously, I has also worked on building [COVID-19 prevalence prediction tools](https://flatten.ca) advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. 

Here are a series of papers, features and talks I have given in this space:

I graduated from the University of Toronto, studying Engineering Science with a major in machine intelligence.

### Fun 

I love to travel (at 50 countries so far), and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
