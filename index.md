**Contributing to the Metaverse.**

Previously, I built products for [public health teams](https://flatten.ca) during the COVID-19 pandemic, did research in [machine learning for health](https://shreyj.com/previous), and built [consumer](https://account.microsoft.com/family/about) products at Microsoft. A more detailed list of my experience can be found [here](https://shreyj.com/previous/).

For fun, I am playing around with generative models to create digital art and music. I wish I could sing or draw, but I can't so I rely on machine learning to help me out. I used to be a triathlete qualifying for three World Championships for Team Canada Triathlon and love to run, swim, row, race really expensive road/TT bikes, and play pickup basketball. 

I am a slight coffee snob and recently started rating coffee shops [here](https://shreyj.com/coffee/). 

Currently a junior at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in machine learning.
