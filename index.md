### My Research 

The central question I am attempting to address is: How we can design systems to counteract information integrity risks from AI and promote democratic pluralism? 

I have attempted at addressing this ambitious problem through answering different narrow, yet also ambitious questions. 

1. How can we build digital communication channels that are shielded from threats due to generative AI?

2. How can we trust who we are communicating with online? 

I am currently an Applied Scientist at [Microsoft Research Special Projects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-research-special-projects/) and Co-Founder of the [Plural Technology Collaboratory](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/) at Microsoft Research. 

### Relevent Contributions

1) [**Plural Publics**](https://gettingplurality.org/2023/03/18/plural-publics/). Published in the Harvard Safra Centre for Ethics. 

In this paper, we defined a new framework for thinking about privacy in the age of AI. Instead of viewing data governance in the traditional “privacy” vs “publicity” lens, we offered a new approach that shields communication channels from threats to contextual integrity due to AI, while still allowing broad, global, instantaneous communication.

This is a research direction I have been leading at Microsoft Research which you can read more about [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/articles/plural-publics/). 

2) [**Designated Verifier Signatures**](https://ethresear.ch/t/designated-verifier-signatures/15100). 

In this project, I co-designed a way to have designated verifier signatures to be accessible today to send **deniable** messages. On the one hand, this primtive can be incredibly useful for protecting your messages from being trained on or taken action upon (protecting secrets), and on the other hand is useful for AI labs to have confidence the message was written by the sender (which may or may not be human). 

3) **Identity Standards** 

Watermarking and content provenance (ie., C2PA) are being widely discussed as ways to improve information authenticity. We have seen how without some identity standard to pair with these techniques, they alone do not solve the threats from generative AI being discussed. Additionally, without an identity layer that is resistent to Sybil threats, censorship, and coersion, any reputation system becomes infeasible to build. 

I have commented on the tradeoffs between different identity primitives like Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and blockchain based standards. You can read more about this in a paper I was the lead author on titled "[A Plural Decentralized Identity Frontier: Abstraction v. Composability Tradeoffs in Web3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11443)". 

To extend on this work, I extended existing work being done with anonymous credentials to co-design [**Zero-Knowlege Identity Badges**](https://github.com/enricobottazzi/ZK-SBT). 

5) **Blog**: I post occasionally on my blog [Glasswing](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/). Some posts that are particularly relevent is my comments regarding the [sociology of secrecy](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/sociology-of-secrecy-and-secret-societies) and defining a [new turing test](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/we-need-a-new-turing-test). 

I have given numerous talks and been on many podcasts relating to this research. Here are a few where I address core parts of my research:

### Previous Work 

My prior work has been centered in AI for healthcare applications. I worked with the [Healthcare and AI team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/health-data-services) at Microsoft on the FHIR standard. I also worked various different kinds multi-modal prediction tasks with EHR, DICOM, and MedTech data. 

I was the Founder and Research Director of a core COVID-19 prediction tool, [Flatten](https://flatten.ca). I was advised by [Professor Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) and [Nick Frosst](https://www.nickfrosst.com/) througout the duration of this project. We raised money to hire 6 full-time employees, partnered with the UN, WHO, and municpal governments in Somalia. We also worked with various different municpal governments in Canada. 

I previously did Health and AI research at the Vector Institute of Technology & MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/). I worked primarily on two separate areas of focus within AI for Health: differential privacy tradeoffs in healthcare with Vinith M Suriyakumar and understanding out-of-distribution performance of LLMs in the clinical context with Nathan Ng. 

I also spent time working at the [MIT Critical Data Lab](https://criticaldata.mit.edu/) under the Advisory of [Leo Anthony Celi](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/faculty/leo-anthony-celi/).

### Fun 

I love most sports, but I spend most of my time between pickup basketball, lifting and triathlons. I have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en). Prior to triathlon, I rowed and raced the double as well as swam comeptitively in the 50, 100, and 200m breastroke. 

I also love trying new foods with people who are seriously passionate about trying new foods.
