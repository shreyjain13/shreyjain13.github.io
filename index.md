### My Research 

My research is concerned with safeguarding the authenticity and accuracy of information. 

I am Applied Scientist at [Microsoft Research Special Projects](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/microsoft-research-special-projects/) and Co-Founder of the [Plural Technology Collaboratory](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/) at Microsoft Research. 

The central question I am attempting to address is: How we can design systems to counteract information integrity risks from Large Foundation Models and promote democratic pluralism? 

I have attempted at addressing this ambitious problem through answering different narrower questions. 

1. How can we build digital communication channels that are shielded from threats due to generative AI?

2. How can we trust who we are communicating with online? 

### Relevent Contributions

1) [**Plural Publics**](https://gettingplurality.org/2023/03/18/plural-publics/). Published in the Harvard Safra Centre for Ethics. 

In this paper, we defined a new framework for thinking about privacy in the age of LFMs. Instead of viewing data governance in the traditional “privacy” vs “publicity” lens, we offered a new approach that shields communication channels from threats to contextual integrity due to LFMs, while still allowing broad, global, instantaneous communication.

This is a research direction I have been leading at Microsoft Research which you can read more about [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/plural-technology-collaboratory/articles/plural-publics/).

3) **Identity Standards** 

4) [**Zero-Knowlege Identity Badges**]

5. **Blog**: I post occasionally on my blog [Glasswing](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/). Some posts that are particularly relevent is my comments regarding the [sociology of secrecy](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/sociology-of-secrecy-and-secret-societies) and defining a [new turing test](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/p/we-need-a-new-turing-test). 

I have given numerous talks and been on many podcasts relating to this research which you can also find below.

### Previous Work 

Previously, I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology & MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/) as well as worked with Microsoft's Health & AI team. 

Previously, I has also worked on building [COVID-19 prevalence prediction tools](https://flatten.ca) advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. 

I graduated from the University of Toronto, studying Engineering Science with a major in machine intelligence. 

### Fun 

I love to travel (at 50 countries so far), and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
