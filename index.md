**My research focus is currently centered around decentralized identities & decentralized funding models.**

I am currently working at Microsoft on the Azure Health AI Team as a PM.

Previously, I built products for [public health teams](https://flatten.ca) during the COVID-19 pandemic, did research in [machine learning for health](https://shreyj.com/previous), and built [consumer](https://account.microsoft.com/family/about) products at Microsoft. A more detailed list of my experience can be found [here](https://shreyj.com/previous/).

For fun, I am playing around with generative models to create digital art and music. I wish I could sing or draw, but I can't so I rely on machine learning to help me out. I used to be a triathlete qualifying for three World Championships for Team Canada Triathlon and love to run, swim, row, race really expensive road/TT bikes, and play pickup basketball.

I am a slight coffee snob and recently started rating coffee shops [here](https://shreyj.com/coffee/).

I am currently a senior at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in machine learning (graduating spring 2023).
