I work at Microsoft Research as an applied scientist on decentralized social technology. My research interests are at the intersection of applied cryptography, machine learning, and political economics. I am also a technical advisor to product teams at Microsoft as it related to my research. 

I have occasional posts on this site, but write more frequently at [Glasswing](https://shreyjaineth.substack.com/). 

I previously did research in machine learning for health at the Vector Institute of Technology & MIT CSAIL under the advisory of [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/people/) as well as worked with Microsoft's Health & AI team. 

Previously, I has also worked on building [COVID-19 prevalence prediction tools](https://flatten.ca) advised by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/) that operated in Canada and Somalia. I love to travel (at 50 countries so far), and have qualified for 3 age group world championship triathlons coached by [Paula Findlay](https://www.instagram.com/paula_findlay/?hl=en).
