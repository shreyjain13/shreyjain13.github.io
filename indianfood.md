After a recent trip to the UK, I can finally share my top 10 Indian restaurants worldwide, based on my visits to ~55 countries. Please note, my choices favor North-Indian cuisine and are entirely vegetarian.

My top three picks stand distinctly above the rest. 

While I lack a rigid evaluation framework, I consider factors like food quality, ambiance, and service. Specifically for Indian cuisine, I also assess how I feel the next day, especially in terms of digestive comfort.

Here are the top ten: 

- Esphahan, Agra, India
- Brigadiers, London, England
- Charcoal, Bangkok, Thailand
- Tamarind, New York City
- Trishna, London, England
- Bukhara, New Delhi, India
- Riyasat, Toronto, Canada
- Adrak, Toronto, Canada
- Hotel Highway King, Jaipur, India
- Maharaja, Toronto, Canada
