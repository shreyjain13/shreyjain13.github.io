There is no need to advertise the tech stack your product is built on in user experience (ie., "Launched on Polygon", or "Data stored on Arweave"). Just be clear on what the user gets by interacting with your product and make the tech stack details available elsewhere. 

When I think about the "pre-work" that people do prior to using a product, I group them into two categories: 

- use the product and figure it out the mechanics of how it works as you use it
- read the documentation and then use the product

The utility that an individual gets from the product is assumed to be greater for the latter case, yet majority of people fit into the former.   

The innovation in crypto is moving really fast and there continues to be this idea that an inflection point in adoption is coming due to a) institutional adoption b) entertainment companies 3) mobile development. Yet, the more I review the early-stage products that are coming out, the more I see design being done with the assumptive demographic design. 

No different than early internet days, a lot of the users were technical people who come from backgrounds in computer science, gaming, or exposure to technology in some way. It still remains that majority of the demographic today with crypto products is very similar. 

I am excited for when documentation and the way we talk about how to interact with products in crypto has less to do with the tech stacks you are using but really focusing on the benefits the user is getting. Documentation is painful, poorly written. For most, it needs to be visual, ideally video format for someone to plain blank walk me through the steps of interacting with your product. And if you hired better designers, you wouldn't even need to think about this problem because your product would be so intuitive from the start.
