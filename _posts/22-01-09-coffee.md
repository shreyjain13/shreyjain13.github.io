After visting the UK properly, I can finally make this post. 

I have now been to ~ 55 countries and in each, usually hit at least one Indian restaurant. I have made a list of my top 10 Indian restaurants aroudn the world. 

Some disclaimers are that I typically only eat North-Indian food and I am vegetarian. 

Here are the top ten: 

- Esphahan, Agra, India
- Brigadiers, London, England
- Charcoal, Bangkok, Thailand
- Tamarind, New York City
- Trishna, London, England
- Bukhara, New Delhi, India
- Riyasat, Toronto, Canada
- Adrak, Toronto, Canada
- Hotel Highway King, Jaipur, India
- Maharaja, Toronto, Canada
