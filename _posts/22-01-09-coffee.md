If you are involved in anything crypto related, you have to know how popular the "gm" messages have become. Here is a photo of a coffee with latte art of "gm" from my favorite shop in Toronto.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I got really into coffee. When I think about the ranges of people who drink coffee, I think about a spectrum of drinking for caffeine to being an absolute coffee snob. I think I lie somewhere closer to snob now. If you know me, the last thing I need is caffeine to make me more energetic. 

My home setup varies depending on the amount I have for coffee. 

- Rushed: Instant cofffe with coffee mate (I know ew.)
- Normal Day: Use my Miele CVA7440 to make a dopio espresso or flat white
- No rush: French press or pour over

I recently spent some time in Hawaii and went through the entire process of seeing how coffee plants are kept, to picking the coffee fruit seeds to roasting and then finally drinking. Random fact I learned, did you know that blonde coffee has more coffee than dark roasted? 

Anyways, as I get more into travelling, I want to build up my coffee list as I travel more.
