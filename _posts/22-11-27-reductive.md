In a world where we are constantly bombarded with information and new ideas, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and bogged down by the sheer amount of choice and complexity. In times like these, it can be helpful to step back and simplify our ideas and worldview in order to make progress in innovation. 

Venture capitalists, directors of large corporations, and many researchers' jobs require them to have a “thesis” on how the world operates. For a long-time I have always felt uncomfortable with the oversimplification that many prominent figures in each of these respective occupations have provided (i.e., Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Andreesen, Richard Wolf, etc.). The claims that I felt uncomfortable were something along the lines of  “the world is going to change for the following reasons: assumption A, assumption B, and assumption C”. 

These assumptions are often well backed with scientific data, yet I always felt as though the way we partition what it is we work on and the importance of that work cannot be modeled in simple assumptions. The world is far more complex than any one individual can articulate, making me believe that each of these figures were over-simplifying problems, and being reductive. 

As I am now in a role where I am responsible for helping guide the direction of a large team, I now understand the value of being reductive. When we reduce our ideas to their core essence, we can more easily see how they fit together and how they can be applied to solve problems. This process of reduction can also help us to identify new possibilities and connections that we may have otherwise missed. Innovation often comes from taking existing ideas and concepts and recombining them in new and creative ways. By being reductive in our thinking, it allows us to partition this incredibly complex world into bits that we can start building towards. 

The reductive argument can be seen as an analogy to a compass: it allows people to have a sense of magnitude without becoming lost in the direction. It is important to spend time considering the direction, but if you are someone who can get lost in trying to model the world and feeling like there is always more to learn before making a decision, it can be helpful to step back and remember the bigger picture. I recently felt this myself when I attempted to learn more about cryptography, economics, and sociology. I never went as deep as I wished and still have years of unanswered questions ahead of me, but remembering the reductive argument helped me to step back and see the forest for the trees.

However, in the interim, I can take what I know, the assumptions I have, and build a reductive argument around why we should do the things we do. 

Where I think being reductive becomes dangerous is when individuals are not open to adapting the assumptions their thesis is built on. Founders who are not open to being wrong, individuals who don’t listen to their friends with an open ear, or anyone who is strongly tied to opinion is a dangerous place to be in and where being reductive scares me.

All in all, I don’t like being reductive. It feels like a “short-cut”, “incomplete”, “a sketch”, yet I think in many ways this is the best approach to getting things done, making progress, and building towards a better picture of the world than if you tried to do it from the beginning. 

No artificial or human intelligence will ever be able to model the world perfectly to understand what the best decision is. Some argue that this debate is a waste of time due to free will, but I think that in the short-term, even on 5 year time-horizons, being reductive can be incredibly powerful in making progress.
