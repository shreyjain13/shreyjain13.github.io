In its current form, the most successful NFT projects provide users with one of two resources: access to physical experiences or digital primitives. Here I comment on why access NFT projects to physical experiences will only increase inequities in the internet and projects focusing on access to digital experiences and primitives will flourish. 

[BAYC](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) has verified the value of having a bridge between the digital and physical world to create a modern version of the SOHO house. Influencers like Gary Vee, artists like Takeoff, and many more are following suit by enabling NFT holders to get access to a physical experiences. The early symptoms of a [physical divide](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1247518697385684992) between income classes is starting to emerge with the challenges it takes to travel and expense needed to take part in entertainment. 

These challenges will only continue to emerge with global inequities in public health response, climate change, and lack of trust in the nation state and continue to push people to seek experiences in a digital world. Right now, this may be spending time on Netflix, YouTube, Instagram or TikTok. But as we continue to develop 3D versions of these experiences that offer richer mechansisms of digital entertainment we will see a shift and for many people will be signifcantly more affordable than the offerings of the physical NFT projects. 

For artists, content creators, or individuals with large followings on digital platforms, it can be very attractive montearily to mimic a "SOHO House" model to add value to your community and make the NFT project look more attractive on paper than simply releasing art. However, think carefully about the future of where your content is going to be displayed, how your community engages with that content, and how the experiences you are offering can add value at scale. 

Decentraland or Sandbox that are providing you with access to digital resources in the Metaverse with many teams following suit in development.
