The types of music heavily depend on the actions I am doing. 

If I am doing a more intense workout, I play EDM / remixes of songs I like. Here is a 20 minute [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Prr5qMdcF0nelLgRGszvt?si=41b8cf4182b049ed) I use for tempo based runs or bikes. 

If I am working out and I need to keep my heart rate below 150 some of the artists I like to listen to include: 

- Juice World
- Drake 
- Kid Laroi 
- Migos
- Gunna 
- Jack Harlow
- Kendrick Lamar
- Kanye
- Young Stoner Life
- Swae Lee
- Lil Yachty 

If I am working and I need to focus, no music. If I am workign and its a light task I have a lofi [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RF5hOECtPQu6fa6VtJpW4?si=eed633a2c00442c6) I like to use. I also love Bossonava Covers. 

If I am just chilling and more upbeat music, here are some artists I love: 

- Surfaces
- Rex Organge County
- Still Woozy
- John Mayer
- Bill Withers
- Zachary Knowles 
- Glass Animals
- Drake
